        The dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is a widely recognized, resilient perennial herb in the daisy family (Asteraceae), known for its bright yellow flowers and spherical, wind-dispersed seed heads. Though often considered a common lawn weed, it is a highly nutritious and ecologically important plant with a long history of culinary and medicinal uses.
